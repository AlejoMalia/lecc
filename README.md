LECC ¬∑ Linked Electronic Communication Core
========================
![HEADER](docs/banner01.png)
**Linked Electronic Communication Core (LECC)** is a modular Python framework for communication across multiple protocols, drawing inspiration from Ray Kurzweil's vision in *The Age of Spiritual Machines*. In the book, Kurzweil imagines a future with a shared electronic communication language, a concept that sparked the idea for this system. LECC enables sending and receiving messages via protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP, MQTT, UART, I2C, and more, with built-in emulation and failure recovery through the unique Maskpert mechanism.

Features
--------

- üåê **Multi-Protocol Support**: Compatible with UART, HTTP, TCP, UDP, WebSocket, FTP, MQTT, I2C, Ethernet, Bluetooth, and Zigbee.
- üîÑ **Automatic Emulation**: Activates an emulator if a protocol fails due to missing hardware or connectivity issues.
- üë∫ **Maskpert**: A smart routing and rescue system ensuring message delivery using alternative protocols when the primary one fails.
- üß© **Modular and Extensible**: Easy to add new protocols or customize existing ones.
- ‚ö° **Concurrency**: Uses threading to handle simultaneous communications without blocking.
- üí™ **Resilience**: Automatic retries and failed message queues to guarantee delivery.

#### What Does It Achieve?

LECC provides a unified system for connecting heterogeneous devices and services. It's perfect for IoT projects, automation, network testing, or any application requiring protocol interoperability.

What is Maskpert?
-----------------

**Maskpert** üë∫ (Masked Expert) is LECC's intelligent failure management system:

- üéØ **Dynamic Routing**: Sends messages across all available protocols and confirms success with a priority protocol (HTTP or TCP by default).
- üß∞ **Message Rescue**: Retrieves failed messages from a queue and resends them via available alternative protocols.

This ensures messages reach their destination even under network or hardware failures.

Installation
------------

#### Requirements

*   Python 3.7 or higher
*   Operating System: Tested on Linux (may require adjustments for Windows/macOS)

#### Dependencies

Install the required libraries with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

See `requirements.txt` for the full list.

#### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:
    
        git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/lecc-universal-system.gitcd lecc-universal-system
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
3.  Run the system:
    
        python3 lecc.py
    

Usage
-----

1.  **Configuration**: Edit `protocol_configs` in `lecc.py` to adjust ports, hosts, or URLs for your environment:
    
        protocol_configs = {    "http": {"port": 5000, "host": "localhost", "url": "http://localhost:5000/api/data"},    "tcp": {"port": 65433, "host": "127.0.0.1"},    # ...}
    
2.  **Execution**: Running the script initializes all modules, tests availability, and sends a test message.
3.  **Expected Output**:
    
        LECC Universal System CompleteStarting HTTP server: Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0) ||| http://127.0.0.1:5000Available (11): ['uart', 'http', 'tcp', ...]Sending from tcp: Automatic test messageSent with maskpert via uart, http, tcp, ..., success with httpLECC System Running...
    
4.  **Customization**: Add your own logic in `LECCCore.route_message()` to process received messages.

Example
-------

Send a custom message by modifying `main()`:

    core.route_message({"data": "Hello world", "destination_protocol": "http"})

Output:

    Sending from http: Hello worldSent with maskpert via ..., success with http

Important Notes
---------------

*   **MQTT**: Requires a broker (e.g., Mosquitto) on `localhost:1883`. If unavailable, it switches to emulation.
*   **UART/I2C**: Needs connected hardware (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`). Without hardware, it simulates.
*   **Ports**: Ensure configured ports are free.
